Exchange programs at Waseda University (Tokyo) and Copenhagen Business School that sparked a deep curiosity for understanding diverse cultures and global perspectives. This experience transformed my approach to learning about the world, leading to systematic exploration of international affairs, regional studies, and cross-cultural understanding through both formal education and self-directed learning.
